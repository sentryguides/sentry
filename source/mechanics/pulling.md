Pulling in Dota means to get your own creeps to attack neutral creeps. It allows
supports to get some gold and experience for themselves, without taking anything
away from their carry. Additionally, it denies gold and experience that your
opponents could otherwise have gotten.

As an introduction, here is a short video that shows how to pull on the Radiant side:

## When to pull

There are good reasons for pulling, but also good reasons not to. Basically, you
should only pull when all of the following is true:

* Your carry does not need you to get last hits and survive
* You need more levels or items to gank other lanes
* The lane is pushed out, your carry would not have to last hit under the tower

## How to pull

When you pull, you need all your creeps to die. If they don't, they will group
up with the next creep wave and push the lane - which is the opposite of what
you want. The problem is that a single small camp is not enough to kill an entire
creep wave. Therefore, there are two options when it comes to executing a successful pull:

1. **Connecting two or more camps**: Pull more camps until all your creeps are dead
2. **Stacking a camp**: A stacked camp is able to kill a creep wave easily

#### Radiant

On the Radiant side, connecting a pull is very easy, you just need a tango. Stack
only if you don't have a tango, or you have a jungler killing the other
camps. There is no downside to stacking other than you having to do it in advance,
but small inefficiencies can sometimes have a big impact.

**The correct timing to pull the small camp on the Radiant side is 10 seconds
after a creep wave spawned, or at 10 and 40 seconds.**

#### Dire

On the Dire side, connecting a pull is somewhat difficult, stacking is recommended here.

**The correct timing to pull the small camp on the Dire side is 15 seconds
after a creep wave spawned, or at 15 and 45 seconds.**
