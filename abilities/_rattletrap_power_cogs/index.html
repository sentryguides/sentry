<h4><img src="/images/dota/abilities/rattletrap_power_cogs-8b93808a.png" width="64"> Power Cogs</h4>
  <div class="">Forms a barrier of energized cogs around Clockwerk, trapping any units that are near.  Enemies outside the trap that touch a cog are knocked back, losing health and mana. Once a cog has delivered a shock, it will power down.  Cogs can be destroyed by enemy attacks, but Clockwerk can destroy them with just one.</div>
  <div class="text-info">Cogs can shock invisible units.</div>
