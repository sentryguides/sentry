<h4><img src="/images/dota/abilities/winter_wyvern_arctic_burn-096002b3.png" width="64"> Arctic Burn</h4>
  <div class="">Winter Wyvern soars upon an arctic wind, granting her unobstructed movement and allowing her to exhale a blistering chill into each attack. While soaring, her attacks travel further and faster, and slow enemies with a magical freeze that strips them of 8% of their current health each second. Her sight is also hardened against night's chill, granting her 400% additional vision range at night while soaring.</div>
  <div class="text-info">Enemy units can only receive the Arctic Burn debuff once per cast.<br />This ability does not affect Roshan.<br />Reduces Winter Wyvern's attack point to 0.1.</div>

<div class="text-muted">The same organ where some dragons stoke their inner flame is, in Auroth, a crucible of unimaginable cold. From deep within her frosty gullet, an exhalation sends enemies into burning agony.</div>
