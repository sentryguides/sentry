  <div class="">Visage generates a layered barrier that protects him from physical and magical attacks.  If he receives damage from a player, one layer is removed, and takes time to recover.</div>
  <div class="text-info">Each time Visage receives damage greater than 2 that was not self-inflicted and was from a player owned source, a layer is removed.</div>
  <div class="">ARMOR PER LAYER: <span class="attribVal">1 / 2 / 4 / 5</span><br />
RESIST PER LAYER: <span class="attribVal">3% / 6% / 12% / 16%</span><br />
MAX LAYERS: <span class="attribVal">4</span><br />
LAYER RECOVERY TIME: <span class="attribVal">4</span></div>
<div class="text-muted">Visage's tough scales share equal properties of ghost and stone, making it nearly impervious to blade and magical assault.</div>
