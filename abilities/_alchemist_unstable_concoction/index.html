<h4><img src="/images/dota/abilities/alchemist_unstable_concoction-2d6355f6.png" width="64"> Unstable Concoction</h4>
  <div class="">Alchemist brews up an unstable concoction that he can throw at an enemy hero, to stun and deal damage in an area around the explosion. The longer the concoction brews, the more damage it deals and the longer the stun. After 5 seconds, the brew reaches its maximum damage and stun time. However, after 5.5 seconds, the concoction will explode on Alchemist himself if not thrown.</div>
  <div class="text-info">Alchemist can move and act normally while brewing.<br />A timer above Alchemist's head will indicate the remaining brew time. This timer is visible to enemies.<br />You can deny yourself with this skill.<br />Unstable Concoction cannot be disjointed.<br />Once thrown, Unstable Concoction stops brewing.</div>
