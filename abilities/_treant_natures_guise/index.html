<h4><img src="/images/dota/abilities/treant_natures_guise-b5537346.png" width="64"> Nature's Guise</h4>
  <div class="">Causes the targeted unit to blend in with the forest, becoming invisible to enemies and gaining a movement speed bonus when near a tree.  If the unit moves away from a tree or the spell is cast on a unit with no nearby trees, Nature's Guise is lost.  Treant Protector can cast spells and remain invisible under Nature's Guise.</div>
  <div class="text-info">If cast on a unit that isn't near a tree, it will lose the invisibility almost instantly.<br />Nature's Guise checks in 1 second intervals for nearby trees, removing invisibility if none are found.</div>
